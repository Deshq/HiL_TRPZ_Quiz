<h4> HiL - small application for testing students. </h4> 

<h6>In which there is registration and authorization for different users: Admin / User. Different actions are available in the application depending on the user's role.</h6> 

<h6>Provides the student (user) the opportunity to log in, select a topic for testing and answer questions provided by the system automatically. Provides the teacher (administrator) the opportunity to log in, add the name of the subject and topic, as well as questions</h6>  
Hidden in List is my free and open-source project.  
Free to use, change, etc.

#### Interaction with login/register control:

To get started, you must register at least one user and administrator account. After that, this data will be transferred to the database and the next time you only need to log in. 
  
After registration, you need to go to the authorization window, enter the login and password and, first, click on the Login as Admin key. If the data was invalid, you will be thrown an Exception.
